        <p >This project was initiated to solve an issue the client, Murdoch University, is facing.
            The issue being they are currently using paper forms which requires manual printing and filling,
            the paper form may also be involved in a physical workflow which requires multiple people signing the form,
            thereby consuming a lot of paper, effort and time.
            This project aims to create a system that alleviates the manual process into a digitalised form generator and filler
            while also easing the workflow process.
